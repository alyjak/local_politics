County Games
############

This combines politics and :doc:`graph_games`, such that people can play
sim-city, but with real political scenarios. This allows people who are curious
about how their government actually works to model and simulate the types of
decisions that guide effective government.

This relies on counties publishing their economic and political data in a
standardized manner, such that personnel can try tweaking policies, modelling
disasters, etc and then simulate results. Scoreboards/leader boards could even
show who the highest performing players are.

This relies also on a way of modelling effectiveness. These models are of course
impossible to fully validate, but given regular economic/political data from a
diversity of sources in a standardized format, we could certainly validate some
models to a fair degree of certainty.
