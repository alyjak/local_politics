Andrew, I'm grateful that you messaged me asking whether or not the world would
implode if a rocket scientist and a neroscientist got together. I think it may
be too early to tell. I knew I loved you from the first time we held hands while
brushing our teeth together. It seems silly, but those little things are what
leave indelible marks on the soul.

Here on our wedding day, I promise to share many more of those moments with you
from now into always. I promise to work tirelessly to cultivate in the both of
us compassion, generosity, ethics, patience, enthusiasm and wisdom as we age and
explore together the infinitely great, the infinetely little, and everything in
between.

Even when our bodies bend and our hands wrinkle, I promise that I will always
try to see you, and to honor the divinity in you, of you, and around you. I
don't promise to solve your problems, buit I do promise to hold your hand and to
be there while you do. I promise to never let you sleep unless you know that I
love you. I promise to be honest. I promise to somehow not to win every
argument. I vow to talk to you about politics and other tricky subjects because
they matter, but to only speak of them for so many minutes in a given day. I
promise to point out snakes when you miss them. You are the friend to whom my
soul is attached to as its better half. You are more dear to me than language
has the power of telling...

Knowing that marriages do not fail, that people fail when they enter into
marriage expecting another to make them whole, I promise myself to take full
responsibility for my spiritual, mental, and physical wholeness. Loving what I
know of you and trusting what I will discover along the way, I give you my
hand. I give you my love. I give you my soul and myself. I take you to be my
husband. I will love you unconditionally and without hesitation, for it is your
compassionate heart that moves me, you spirit that inspires me, you awkward
humar that manages to delight me, and you hand that I want to hold for all of
our days

Andrew to Brandy

Brandalyn, here on our wedding day I humbly acknowledge the sacred commitment we
are offering one another. I have a livetime of love and friendship to give you
and I vow to always support you.

Today at this ceremony, the two tributaries of our lives join to become a
stronger river. As each river bank has its own distinct nooks and bends, so too
are our lives each our own, but now we will share the same rapids and slow lazy
stretches as our lives flow once again back to the sea, where one day we will
merge once again into the greater cosmos.

Brandy, I love you. You know I'm not a natual romantic or all that suave, but
for you, believe me I'll try my best.

Brandy, I love you because of your inner and outer beauty. I love you because
your emotional and moral centers are so strong and I delight in drawing from and
supporting them.

I love you because of your tireless support of your fellow human beings. I draw
meaning from reaffirming and supporting that commitment.

I love you because of your patience with my flaws, and your tolerance, sometimes
grudgingly given, for how much of a goober I am.

I love you because of your quiet silliness. I love you because your memory and
your perception are so much clearer than mine. Yes, I even love you because
somehow, some way you always end up being right. So here Brandy, I give you my
vows:

* I vow to always be by your side
* I vow to keep up with you -- whatever the adventure
* I vow to pick you up and carry you whenever you need a break
* I vow to be your number one fan
* I vow to place our life together above all other commitments
* I vow to acknowledge my flaws and always work on improving them
* I vow to never take a good thing for granted
* I vow to love you forever
