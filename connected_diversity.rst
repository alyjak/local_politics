my ethics resolve around:

support diversity
support connectivity
support peer-to-peer cooperation


Thought and agreement as an alternating current, RF-like system:

- Fractal impedance matching
- Politics as wave first system
- Strategies to match at various levels of resolution
- give and take, sources and sinks and individuals. Theory is citizens can't just be voting agents, need to have more skin in the game
