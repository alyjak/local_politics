\lettersection{Introduction}
Dear Raytheon recruitment team,

I recently moved to Indianapolis after living and working in Los Angeles for
over eight years. During this time, I have been employed by SpaceX. I worked
remotely for SpaceX on a temporary contract, which has recently been completed I
am looking to move on, and searching for new adventures in an exciting, future
driven company local to this city.

My interests revolve around bridging the digital and physical world in ways that
are intuitive and safe. At SpaceX, I implemented and executed software assurance
activities related to ensuring the safety and quality of flight software for the
Falcon and Dragon vehicles. In this position I gathered and maintained
experience in a diverse range of engineering fields: examples include the
``hard'' engineering fields such as aerospace, electrical, and computer
engineering, as well as the ``soft'' engineering fields such as process,
quality, and requirements engineering.

Additionally, I have had numerous opportunities to collaborate with my wife on
machine learning problems and their solutions related to her work as a
neuroscientist specializing in studying imaging and genetics related to the
understanding of Alzheimer's disease. This is how I have developed proficiency
with R, specifically associated with its tremendous capabilities in the fields
of machine learning and data analysis.

% \lettersection{Why Ice Miller?}

% Many of the hard and interesting problems I work on at SpaceX involve the
% intersection of regulation and data interpretation. Having the opportunity to
% further explore this area of my experience intersts me greatly. I believe that
% technology has not achieved its potential for empowering decision makers who
% need to quickly interpret data and regulations in order to understand the
% salient points of their cases. I would love to further explore this area with
% the Ice Miller firm, and I believe the Application Data Analyst position is
% perfect do this.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

My background in aerospace engineering should prove my technical and analytical
acumen, while my broad range of software experience at SpaceX should prove my
broad skill set, self motivation, and ability to quickly learn on the job. I
pride myself in basing my work on first principles, this helps maintain focus on
the right solution, not just what is currently popular or hyped. I believe I
have established a reputation for being a reliable, valued, and respected member
of each team I have had the pleasure of working with. I look forward to having
further conversations with the Raytheon team!
