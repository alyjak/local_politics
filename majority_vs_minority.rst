Majority vs Minority Government
###############################

It is interesting to think about how different governments would be, given an
otherwise identical individual but differing if they plan on governing from the
majority vs govern from the minority


Other interesting facets of this:

* Look into how overlapping groups work vs clearly separated groups
* How conflicting are political science opinions on voting capabilities of the
  commonwealth?
