Main Idea: If you put a democratic ownership process around the means of producing a lattice of
trusted keypairs, then you can safely create safe broadcast communities. As soon as you can create
safe broadcast communities, then you can broadcast a certain permission set of your tracking stream.

If you then own private, personal access to your entire tracking stream (your personal root cert is
the only complete authority), and you have control over your backup options, then you can start
developing tools for managing and utilizing your, and your broadcast communities tracked content.

These tools should have the pull to work as software people would be willing to pay for, because
they are a way to 1) control their presence in the ad space, 2) give the power of analyitics to an
ordinary person and provide that in a public arena for social media. Such a space could really open
up monopoly over online discourse that the social media giants hold.

I believe you can create a lattice of trusted keypairs via a democratic process via an algorithm
producing a dag of re-signing operations between cliques of neighbors creating a Shamirs shared
secret key that is used to sign a set of external trusted keys.

Trusted keys are then mapped to permission IDs, that are defined as part of the protocol. Tracking
actions are mapped to these permission IDs by the user. A user's tracking action configuration is
the encrypted and only accessible through the user's private key.
