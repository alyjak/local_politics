What is a Smart Home?
*********************

#. A smart home is a home that stops being inanimate and becomes a living part of your family.
#. A smart home realizes its not that smart.
#. A smart home acts more like a pet dog, less like a butler.
#. A smart home tries to take care of itself.
#. A smart home is happy when you are around, curious, suspicious, or alarmed when someone it
   doesn't know is around and you are not there.
#. A smart home lets you know what it wants or if its not feeling very good.
#. A smart home is trainable by you -- directly or indirectly by observing you.
#. A smart home is in your home, not in a cloud. A cloud home is a hivemind home.
#. A smart home is social and wants to know its neighbors.
#. A smart home develops a personality.
#. A smart home wants to grow like a tree grows -- it starts small and fragile and becomes more
   resilient and nurturing over time. It also wants to be part of a diverse forest of similar
   devices.

   tracking.
#. A smart phone is in your possession, not in a cloud. A cloud phone is a hivemind phone.
