Dear Jane

This is a hard letter to write. We came across your husband’s obituary in our background searches on the house and he sounds like an incredible man. We are so sorry for your loss. We wish we could meet in more pleasant circumstances, but sometimes the universe moves in strange and mysterious ways. In fact, we noticed that you are a member of a UU congregation. We are active members of a Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Indianapolis, and once we move, we expect to join the Ann Arbor Congregation. Regardless of your decision in this matter, we hope to meet you someday in more pleasant circumstance.

We would like to introduce ourselves. We are Andrew, Brandy, and Odessin. Currently we live in Indianapolis but are looking for a home in Ann Arbor since Andrew was hired for a new job back in his home town. Like your husband, Andrew is an engineer and is the third generation of his family to make his home in Ann Arbor. He and Brandy met five years ago when he was working for SpaceX in Los Angeles and she was completing a Ph. D in neuroscience. We recently had our first child, Odessin, who just turned one year old.

We are excited to move to the area, since Andrew’s family still lives here. In fact, the location of your house is mid-way between Odessin's Grandma's as well as Aunt and Uncle's houses. The attached suite would be perfect for Odessin's Grandfather to live with us as well.

Your house is beautiful. We were taken with your home the second we laid eyes on it. In fact, we decided to pause our house search for a home for a while, but felt compelled to drive up to Ann Arbor to see your house as soon as we saw the listing this morning.

We aren’t sorry we did. It’s so clear that this home is well-loved and well-cared for. It is unique and beautiful and we are drawn to almost everything about it. We know that homes like this are few and far between. We’re drawn the character and the natural setting. The house, and its setting; the pond, old sycamore and hickory trees, as well as the charming neighborhood clearly demonstrate the love and beauty that we hope to be able to participate in.

Thank you,

Andrew Lyjak and Brandalyn Riedel
