Monopoly Regulation in the Twenty First Century
###############################################

Because network effects are getting stronger, monopolies are becoming more inevitable in each
market. The usual path is for government to break the monopolistic party up, or regulate them as a
public/private partnership. What if, instead once a company approached something like 40% of market
saturation they automatically entered a stricter non-discrimination regulatory
environment. Effectively their regulatory burden becomes stricter, similar to how when you earn
more, you get a higher tax burden. Not only does this work to curb the side effects of monopolies in
a capitalist society, it's more efficient for the government to regulate because the areas that
require high regulatory oversight by law are by definition a small number of corporate entities.
