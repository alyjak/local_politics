Federal Government Objectives
#############################

Federal governments ability to tax should be limited to these areas. These areas
should be seen as supplimental to local government authority and only intended
as boundary conditions to ensure the collective federation does not tear itself
apart.

The majority of government spending should therefore come from local levels of
government. This encourages diversification of political approaches and ensures
constituents can make more rational economic decisions through emmigration.

Assure the security of matters of the common good
*************************************************

The federal governments responsibilities should be limited to thes

* Defense of our sovereignity

  * Military defense
  * Borders and immigration policies

  * Monopolies -- public and private (federal and state overreach, as well as
    business) -- Nuclear and biological Weapons regulation -- infectious disease

  * Ammendments
  * Emmigration
  * Constitutional Judicial arbitration

Federal Roles
*************

federal government rolse should be limited to those of these categories

Federal government's ability to regulate and prosecute should be limited to these areas.

The engines of innovation and creativity should not be operated by the
government, but influenced via regulation and grants. Federal employees should
be solely focused on either operational, administrative (data gathering), or
strategic (resource allocation and polical agenda) work.

* Operational types of work

  * Judicial
  * Government asset operations

* Administrative

Federal governance should be as free from special interests as is possible. It
should be dry and boring. Special interests should have much more sway at local
areas of government, but should of course still be regulated by the general
rules of governance. Local governments should have the flavor of teams -- the
locality should attach pride and identity to their location. Look at
universities, or university towns for examples of this sort of civic/sports
pride.

* Thought: maybe this is the basis of the local unit? Universities? -- natural
  feeder system starting at local schools, going to state colleges?
