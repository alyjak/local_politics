Local governance doesn't always mean geophysical locality. I would like to
expand the meaning to include specialist areas of governance and
regulation. This could be a way of containing the influence of special interests
such that they are empowered to initiate change within the governance real of
their realm of specialist governance, while minimizing the impact of such
influence on the commonwealth.

The key here that I have to develop is how to define an area of specialist
governance and then how to define how to populate representatives in that area.

The going example I have is with specialist safety regulation:

For example, petrochemical safety standards are not federally enforced but there
is a petrochemical society that has such standards which, as I understand, are
widely used. It would be beneficial if such standards were modified and ratified
through a public-private legislative body and treated as governance.
