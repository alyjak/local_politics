Mycelium

This is the home for the architecture of Mycelium: the micro ecological
environment simulation/modelling engine.

The functional purpose of Mycelium is explained in :ref:`sim-engine`.

Identifiers
===========

.. TODO: Maybe this isn't as important as I initially thought. Model IDs are
   important, embedding namespacing in IDs is very useful when
   creating/referencing tree-like structures -- but this may not really be a
   core concept.

Identifiers are important to formalize because simulations are intended to be
modular. Someone should be able to easily import someone else's work to use as a
template while maintaining a link to the original source. Names need to be
referencable in a stable manner for this to work well.

Identifiers use the following syntax:

global_id = model_id:node_id

model_id = model ids must be globally unique. allowed characters:
``[a-z0-9_\-.]``. uppercase are converted to lowercase.

node_id: local identifier (internal to the model). Identifiers need only be
unique within the model.

.. TODO: Identifiers can be inferred as well if there's just a list
         of items (use indices)?

********
Language
********

Rust. Although not mature, I believe that Rust is the most compelling language
with which to make a full fledged micro-climate simulation engine.

Pros:

* A typed language, this helps when developing complicated functions that need
  to mirror reality as well as ensure data safety
* The compiler is designed from the ground up for memory safety and to enable
  multi-threaded applications. The simulations I want to perform are liable to
  be very process intensive and I want to enable these to run in local
  environments.
* Can be compiled for mac/windows/linux/android/ios. Most environments have
  this, but its good to note.
* Can be used in pretty bare bones environments -- I would like to be able to
  experiment with pieces of code in IOT devices -- specifically garden
  monitoring devices.
* Massively open source: Spearheaded by Mozilla, all code I've seen is open
  source.
* Great community, the language is well loved: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages
* Is immature: If I have the vision, I am in a place where I can influence many
  of the libraries needed to make this work.


Cons:

* Is immature: If I need something, most of the time it exists, but isn't stable
  or full-featured. There are three great tracking sites for getting a feel for
  where rust is, with respect to the types of features I will need:

  https://www.arewewebyet.org/
  http://arewegameyet.com/
  http://www.arewelearningyet.com/

* No existing models. I'll have to develop them. This is probably necessary
  regardless of what language I use anyways if I want to have a performant
  engine.

Engine
******

Entity Component System appears to be the best architecture for creating an
adaptable modular simulation engine.

Here's a compelling blog post on the topic:
https://hackernoon.com/ecs-vs-oop-by-example-daa712b24869

Essentially, data representation is key. My belief is that this approach will
enable quicker iteration on models, and lower the burden on adding additional
modelling capabilities. But, first and foremost I believe it will enable safer
parallelism.

I have spec'd https://github.com/slide-rs/specs as the ECS.

Higher level tools in https://www.amethyst.rs/ may also be useful.


**********************
Issues and first steps
**********************

TODO: Expand, just random notes right now.

First off, in order to get started with the engine, I need to have a grasp on
data input and visualization. Therefore, although I thought the engine would be
the first thing I work on, it won't be. Instead I'm going to focus on
visualization and input. This is compelling mainly because I believe it
should be easier to start working with open source libraries in order to gain
experience. Also, the visualization side is more demo-friendly and should be
easier to "show off" in terms of finding employment in the near term. This is
necessary because I don't think its tractable to use ecoHood/mycelium as
employment in the near term so I need to get a job that both pays the bills and
sets me up for long term success.

I'm thinking I should focus on SVG libraries to start off -- I believe they are
generally under developed in the entire ecosystem and they also let me hit a
large swath of the stack that needs to work for the success of mycelium. In
short, svg is a web technology and is rendered by clients, but its also a
graphics technology so I get to learn about the GPU stack, tessellation and
meshes, as well as all the associated mathematics.

The followign reddit post has been useful. I'm thinking of trying to work with
the lyon library. I've already been intrigued by the Servo project. I think it
could serve as the platform for making a neat svg editor for the purposes of
mycelium input.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/7knfnm/announcing_libresvg_an_svg_rendering_library/

It also sets me up to work on some plotting libraries and integrating with cool
technologies and ideas like D3 and ggplot.

It also is the way I can get working on graph visualization ideas I've had for
quite some time.


*****************
Models to develop
*****************

Need to be really careful here about licenses. I think I can make mycelium free
and open source with just a connection to the ecohood platform, but this needs
lawyers and stuff.
