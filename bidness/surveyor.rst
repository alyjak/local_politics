Getting a Good Client Together
==============================


May be worth contributing here to learn and get the ecosystem running:

Machine Learning Approaches
===========================

Getting Started:

* https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/
* https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

Rust and Tensorflow:
