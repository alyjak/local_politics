Bihome Alpha Design Brief

.. rubric:: PINA NatureWise Design Contest

Climate change, coupled with ever growing global supply chains are continually increasing the strain
on the ecological webs that sustain life on planet Earth. Traditionally, suburban living has been
seen as part of the problem. Our entry, named BiHome Alpha, attempts to change that by exploring
sustainable living practices within a suburban landscape.

BiHome Alpha serves as the initial testbed for an application we are developing, named BiHome. This
application helps users to understand basics of permaculture design, serving as an automated
permaculture consultant that provides land management techniques, training, and designs tailored for
each user's situation. The intention is to lower the permaculture knowledge barrier, thereby
empowering users to apply permaculture principles and start transforming sterile suburban landscapes
into sustainable, practical, and self regulating suburban biomes -- thereby helping to harmonize the
human and ecological communities within these environments.

In this design, we apply permaculture principles to a 0.6 acre partially wooded property. The focus
areas of the plan are as follows:

* Continuous Improvement: Throughout the seasons, data will be collected in order to compare
  performance between the baseline and transformed landscape. Input data will include time, money,
  and external material for initial development and maintenance of both. Output data will include
  metrics of human and ecological interest, including analysis of soil health and carbon content,
  water management, as well as measuring the yield of the human-consumable goods produced within the
  landscape.
* Intentional integration of Mycelium into newly developed plots to aid in plant growth, increase
  soil health, and provide edible mushrooms.
* Integration of cost effective water management and retention techniques

Other than these themes, the design incorporates an indoor set up for growing seedlings, a spiral
herb garden, multiple raised beds planted with annual guilds, a small food forest, a natural pool,
and "the ziggurat" -- a hill created from the backfill of the pond that does double duty as a
terraced garden.

Although no part of this entry was developed within the app, we have attempted to use this contest
entry to develop the aesthetic of the app, and execution of this project provides first-hand
experience that is invaluable for developing app's functionality and use case.
