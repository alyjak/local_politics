Write Up
========

permaculture presents a way of living in harmony with nature, developing a large biomass within a
small amount of space, all with minimal external inputs. Suburban landscapes, especially in the
temparate regions of the United States are well suited to take advantage of these
factors. Permaculture provides a tool to develop self sufficient suburban economies that profit off
their local labor and minimize their reliance on complicated global supply chains. Such a change does
not mean severing suburban landscapes from the global economy, in fact, it may even increase the
output from suburbia to our shared cultural endowmennt. By increasing self sufficiency while
minimizing input, more citizense can devote themselves to more rewarding creative endeavors.

Within this design, we explore a suite of complimentary techniques, all inspired from the permaculture
toolbox in order to further this hypothesis. The development, hereafter referred to as bihome alpha,
will serve as the testbed for developing 

As with any permaculture-based enterprise, this effort is intended to grow over time, transitioning
in the same manner as an ecosystem from a pioneer stage onto a climax community. In this case, the
clix community is a sustainable relationship between modern homo sapiens and nature.

THe app provides the informational backbone of the effort. 

Further iterations integrate the wider neighborhood, allowing neighbors to easily help one another
out both through sharing the toil, as well as the bounty of their harvests.

Each app user gives back to the wider community by voluntarily supplying information about their
plantings, problems and harvests. This information feeds back into the application, increasing
scientific knowledge and predictive capabilities that enable more efficient and wholistic ecological
communities every season.

The information is shared through a wikipedia-style offering available to the community. This
community curated site collects plant, soil, and other ecosystem information from the app (all
shared only based on a user's direct approval), as well as shares procedures and advice from the
greater community for users who are ready to commit to a new planting or other new endavor.
