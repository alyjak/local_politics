Explanation of Design
*********************

Climate change, coupled with ever growing global supply chains are continually increasing the strain
on the ecological webs that sustain life on planet Earth. Traditionally, suburban living has been
seen as part of the problem. Our entry, named BiHome Alpha, attempts to change that by exploring
sustainable living practices within a suburban landscape.

BiHome Alpha serves as the initial testbed for a web application we are developing, named
BiHome. This application helps users to understand permaculture design principles. It acts as an
automated permaculture consultant in order to provide land management techniques, training, and
project designs tailored for each user's situation. The intention is to lower the permaculture
knowledge barrier, thereby empowering homeowners to apply permaculture principles and start
transforming sterile suburban landscapes into sustainable, practical, and self regulating suburban
biomes. Accomplishing these objectives will help to harmonize the human and ecological communities
living within, or replaced by, suburban homes.

In this design, we apply permaculture principles to a 0.6 acre partially wooded property. Principle
focus areas of the plan are as follows:

* Continuous improvement: Throughout the seasons, data will be collected in order to compare
  performance between the baseline and transformed landscape. Input data will include time, money,
  and external material for initial development and maintenance of both. Output data will include
  metrics of human and ecological interest, including analysis of soil health and carbon content,
  water management, as well as measuring the yield of the human-consumable goods produced within the
  landscape.
* Intentional integration of Mycelium into newly developed plots to aid in plant growth, increase
  soil health, and provide edible mushrooms.
* Integration of cost effective water management and retention techniques
* Applying the permaculture principle of designing for multiple uses.

Other than these themes, the design incorporates a yard-wide `Rainwater Retention`_ system, a small
`Fruit Tree Guild`_, a `Natural Pool`_, and "`The Ziggurat`_" -- a hill created from the backfill of
the pool that does double duty as a terraced garden, as well as a collection of three smaller
perennial installations.

Although no part of this entry was developed with our software, we have attempted to use the contest
to develop an aesthetic for our maps, as well as better understand the data requirements for the app
to function successfully. Indeed, execution of this project has provided invaluable first-hand
experience for creating the functionality and use cases necessary for our permaculture application's
eventual success.

Proposed Budget and Timeline
****************************

Execution of this design spans over two years. In the first year, all projects other than the
natural pool and ziggurat will be completed. Note that a trimmed-down version of the ziggurat
terraced garden will be installed the first year using standard raised garden beds. Extra soil for
the beds will be moved from preparing the back yard rain garden.

:Per Project Cost:
   #. Stormwater Swale: **$227**
   #. Mushroom Patch: **$218.84**
   #. Fruit Tree Guild: **$300.05**
   #. Rainwater Retention: **$529.55**
   #. Herb Spiral: **$13**
   #. Pergola: **$16**
   #. Natural Pool: **$11,634.94**
   #. The Ziggurat: **$2080**
   #. Terrace Plantings: **$200.43**
   #. Hazelnut Patch: **$20**
   #. Rain Garden: Included in the Stormwater swale project
   #. Berry Patch: **$114.38**
:Total cost for the first year projects: $1,701.2 * 10% uncertainty = **$1,870**
:Total cost for the second year projects: $13664.94 * 20% uncertainty = **$16,400**
:Total cost: **$18,270**

Note that the cost of this entire project greatly exceeds the contest prize money, but according to
the plan, 10 of the 12 planned projects can be completed for roughly half of the $5000
prize. Receiving the prize would ensure that the first year's projects are completed, as well as
provide incentive to execute the following year on the complete design. Securing the additional
funds is not a risk, as we have the capability to self-fund the remainder of the project.

Refer to `Appendix A: Detailed Cost and Activity Breakdown`_ for further details on each project,
including a breakdown of the tasks and supplies necessary for their completion. Refer to `Appendix
B: Assessment Against the Permaculture Design Principles`_ for a self assessment of the design
against the 12 permaculture design principles.

Appendix A: Detailed Cost and Activity Breakdown
************************************************

Stormwater Swale
================

:Description: This stormwater drainage system meanders through the front yard, where its flow is
   slowed by planting with a native flower/grass seed mix specially designed for detention
   basins. By slowing the water's flow, it can be better absorbed on the lower bank, thereby
   creating 'lenses' of underground water for the `Mushroom Patch`_ and `Fruit Tree Guild`_ to draw
   upon. Water comes into the swale in the north western corner of the yard from the road as well as
   the northern half of the home's roof. The flow of the water is slowed by the plants so that it
   partially functions as a swale, even though there is a slope from the north western corner to the
   end at the south western corner of the front yard. Water overflow from the backyard rain basin is
   channeled to this southern corner of the swale, where the overflow connects to existing city
   stormwater management systems. The water management system is further described in the `Rainwater
   Retention`_ project below.

:Area: ~1800 ft :sup:`2`
:Schedule:
   .. csv-table::
      :header: Task, Hours, Schedule, Notes

      Dig swale, 6 hours, As soon as ground isn't frozen, "Average swale depth: 6 in, width: ~6
      feet. The start and end should be deeper to create pooling areas where the storm water overflow
      joins the swale"
      Plant Cover crop, 0.5 hours, "Start area off with cover crop to out-compete the residual grass
      and add nitrogen. Cover is mix of rye (comes with seed mix, and clover)"
      Plant seed mix, 0.5 hours, "Mix of Detention basin mix for the higher sunlight areas at the start
      and end, and shady woodland mix for the middle areas"
:Schedule Summary: This is the first item to complete and has the least amount of prerequisites for
                   starting. Digging the swale can be done in a day once the ground unfreezes.

                   The principle work for this project can be completed in a weekend by one
                   person, although the seed mix will not be fully established for three years.

:Description: Four types of mushroom as well as two Pawpaw trees reside underneath a mature forest
   canopy of red oak and tulip trees. This project take advantages of the mature trees and the
   plantings should thrive in the moist dappled sunlight of this environment. The focus of this bed
   is to learn and explore mushroom cultivation, and hopefully supply bountiful crops of gourmet
   mushrooms as well as Pawpaw fruit.

Natural Pool
============

:Description: A natural pool in the style of David Pagan Butler (http://organicpools.co.uk). The
   tasks listed below are an abbreviated version of what appears in his manual. The pool depth is 8
   feet. Execution of this project provides a habitat for small wetland creatures, as well as a more
   sustainable (and cheaper) version of the suburban dream of owning a pool. Potentially the pool
   can be stocked with fish and used as an aquaculture as well as providing a recreation area,
   although that isn't factored into the project as the nutrient balance for such an endeavor must
   be carefully managed.

   The overall area is 32 ft x 52 ft. The project gracefully integrates into the surrounding rain
   basin, although the water from each is separated by a berm. The swimming area is 20 ft x 40
   ft. The regeneration zone wraps around the northern and eastern edges, the southern edge is
   reserved for wading. Max depth of the regeneration zone is 2 ft. North and south edges are 6 ft,
   eastern edge is 12ft before reaching the swimming zone. Mortar was estimated using
   https://www.inchcalculator.com/concrete-block-calculator/

:Area: 2000 ft :sup:`2`

:Schedule Summary: This is a multi-month project and will likely require help, as well as many
   vacation days and weekends to complete. Contract support is not factored into the cost. This
   project will only be started once all other projects are complete (minus the ziggurat formed from
   the backfill from creating the pool). Execution is contingent on receiving proper permits from
   the city as well as securing the funds and time off required for construction.

The Ziggurat
============

:Description: A terraced hill made from fill dirt from the natural pool. The terraces alternate
   between planting beds and walkways, with the walkways half as wide as the beds. Average slope is
   1 vertical for each 2 horizontal. Each terrace level is retained with earthbags. The earthbags
   are covered in soil and then planted with a cover crop. Maximum height of the hill is 10.5
   ft. Total width and length are 44 ft and 38 ft respectively.

:Area: 1800 ft :sup:`2`
:Schedule:
   .. csv-table::
      :header: Task, Hours, Schedule, Notes

      Remove the topsoil and place it to the side, , when starting the pool dig,
      Roughly shape the hill with the backhoe, , After completing the pool dig,
      "Construct terraces on each level by first clearing and flattening the area for the bags", "2
      days", ,
      Fill and install bags, 4 days, ,
      Add an underlayer of brush to each planting terrace to aid in water retention, , ,
      Add the topsoil back to each planting terrace, , ,

      Install erosion control plants over the bags, , ,
:Schedule Summary: This project uses the subsoil excavated from the `Natural Pool`_ project, so can
   only commence once the swimming area of the pool is dug. Therefore this project will not be
   started until year two. The major schedule item is creation of the terraces. According to the
   estimated supplies, 1200 sand bags must be filled and placed in order to complete all five
   terraces. Once that step is complete, the beds and paths must be prepared, which is likely to
   take an additional set of weekends. Overall estimate for preparing the ziggurat is 6 complete
   weekends.

Terrace Plantings
=================

:Description: Three garden areas are built into `The Ziggurat`_, One is an implementation of
   Jajarkot's Advanced Polyculture (from Gaia's Garden by Toby Hemenway). Second is the classic
   three sisters guild with corn, squash, and pole beans. Finally, a polyculture will be developed
   which integrates the other vegetables listed in the supplies below. As long as seeds are saved,
   the cost should be a one time item.

*****************************************************************
Appendix B: Assessment Against the Permaculture Design Principles
*****************************************************************

Observe and Interact
====================

This design was born out of observing the flow of the landscape, with a desire to interact with its
positive aspects in a meaningful way.


Catch and Store Energy
======================

Although the ground at our location is nearly flat, we have found a way to work with the minimal
elevation change and create a water cycle that spans the entire property. Additionally, this design
makes effective use of the available sunlight energy to create edible plants and biomass.


Obtain a Yield
==============

Most of the projects included in this design have a yield of some sort. Even the `Natural Pool`_
creates a yield, both in terms of enjoyment of the outdoors as well as the possibility of
incorporating fish or edible water plants such as cattails at a later date.


Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback
=========================================

Currently suburban landscapes are remarkable in terms of their lack of internal feedback: goods come
in, waste goes out. This landscape attempts to create internal cycles through development of plant
communities which can self regulate and develop productive growth through incoming water and biomass
inputs.


Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services
==============================================

The primary example of this principle is through the `Rainwater Retention`_ system and its
connections to most of the other projects.


Produce No Waste
================

All biomass produced from this design is planned to be incorporated back into the soil through low
energy activities such as chop and drop mulching. In addition, the rain water detention basins help
to reduce stormwater 'waste' in the neighborhood by slowing and absorbing moisture from heavy rains.

Additionally, the backfill subsoil produced from the construction of the natural swimming pool is
turned from a liability into an asset by creation of `The Ziggurat`_ garden terrace. The terraces
help to take advantage of the prime sunlight areas for growing edible crops and also helps with
water management by creating a system where, if watering is necessary, water can be sourced from the
pool, run to the top terrace, and gravity can be used to supply water from there to the lower
terraces.


Design from Patterns to Details
===============================

Polycultures are utilized in this design to a great degree. This follows the pattern in nature where
growth occurs in diverse communities and not in monocultures. In addition, the meandering path of
the `Stormwater Swale`_ in the front yard maximizes the surface area available for water to flow,
with helps to simultaneously provide the maximum water absorption area and provide useful sources of
moisture for the mushroom patch and fruit tree guild while also keeping those projects from becoming
water logged.


Integrate Rather than Segregate
===============================

No single project in this design is intended to stand alone. The water management system integrates
water sources with the polycultures that take advantage of them. The natural pool feeds its excess
water into the rain garden. The `Mushroom Patch`_ takes advantage of the shade and existing micro
cultures sure to be developed underneath the mature red oak tree in order to further develop the
fecundity of the area and provide an edible crop.


Use Small and Slow Solutions
============================

A goal for this design is to provide a locally sourced food crop that can supplement our reliance on
mass agriculture. In addition, the knowledge gained by developing (and occasionally failing) when
implementing this design can be integrated into the BiHome permaculture application we are
developing. This will help spread the small and slow solutions advocated by the permaculture design
principles to a wider audience.


Use and Value Diversity
=======================

When sourcing plants for this design, we endeavored to incorporate heirloom varieties as well as
plants adapted to the local environment. In addition, inclusion of the `Rain Garden`_ feature should
provide a draw to the local wildlife - providing a micro-ecosystem where small local wildlife can
thrive.

Use Edges and Value the Marginal
================================

Edges are most apparent in the `Stormwater Swale`_ feature of the front yard as well as the beds of
`The Ziggurat`_ garden terrace. The backyard `Rain Garden`_ turns a liability into an asset by
transforming the back quarter of the backyard from a stagnant pool over patchy grass into a vibrant
semi-wetland full of flowers, birds, and small amphibians.

Creatively Use and Respond to Change
====================================

Suburban landscapes are not going to disappear anytime soon, but the practices that have sustained
them for the past sixty years can no longer be ethically justified. By re-envisioning suburbia as
not simply supplanting nature, but as the incorporation of medium density populations into
semi-managed natural landscapes we can change both the paradigm and economy we rely on to support
our first world way of life. Although it is only a baby step, this design tries to take a positive
step in the right direction, introducing a narrative of how little it really costs to make living
for humans, and living for nature easier and more sustainable.
