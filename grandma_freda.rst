When my brother and I sat down to write this memorial we realized that for us, our memories of Grandma are not so much formed around specific stories or events, but rather are about the rituals and environment she shaped around us.

When I look back at my memories of Grandma, they are lush, green, and filled with light. Grandma was an amazing gardener. All spring and summer long she would be out in her garden tending to her large, brightly colored flowers. My brother and I would stay with her days and sometimes weeks. She was always nurturing a new fruit tree or garden patch into life. She had a dense vegetable garden full of cucumbers, broccoli, squashes and tomatoes. She had a towering bean pole, and an asparagus patch for early springtime eating. There was a large raspberry patch in the back that we pilfered from while supposedly helping her with the harvest.

In the kitchen, she transformed the food from her backyard into delicious multi course meals. Having grown up through the great depression, she cared about self reliance, and always having good food on the table. She would have multiple dishes in the oven, and multiple dishes on the stove, and some kind of fruit cobbler, or a pie she made from her own berries. And then after dinner we would eat dessert while playing games and drinking half cups of coffee from the tiniest of china cups. Frequently we played Scrabble. Grandma always won, she didn't go easy on us and got tremendous joy from trouncing us game after game.

Above all Grandma was extremely deliberate in everything she did. From her, we learned that it's not about the words we speak but what you do and how you live that really counts. She was fiercely independent, living on her own even at the age of 92. And when finally she was unable to care for herself as she always had before, Grandma said her final goodbyes and that was that. She died exactly how she lived: on her own terms.

Grandma, I will keep your memory alive by remembering your caring strength, and when times are rough, we will persevere with a quiet direction and deliberate pace. Finally, I can only hope that when the time comes I too will have the courage to leave this earth on my own terms.


Farewell Grandma,
We love you
