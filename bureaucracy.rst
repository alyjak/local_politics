Reform Bureaucracy
##################

I would assert that Bureacracy is how the 'wet' world enforces
protocols. By wet world I mean human governance. This is in contrast
to dry protocols, such as Ethernet, TCP/IP, etc. Protocols are
obviously very valuable. Good protocols reduce risk for upstart ideas,
such as new businesses, as existing adopted protocols are information
commodities. By this I mean that if you want to start an email
service, it doesn't mean you have to reinvent the internet. You can
layer your service on top of the existing informational flows that
exist and provide value for many more people and companies than just
you and yours.

In order to get a complete picture of buraucracy in the context of
information protocols, we have to focus on incentives for the conduit,
aka the bureaucrat and also focus on the information transaction being
executed.

What general types of transaction are provided by a bureaucracy?

#. Certification --> public acknowledgement that a party is qualified
   to perform a task. Examples: License/registration, vehicle
   safety. For this type of transaction the bureaucrat is often
   empowered to make a yes/no decision based on a pre-existing
   workflow and expected dataset.
#. Information gathering --> Acquiring information, interpreting that
   information, then providing recommendations to decision makers. For
   this type of transaction the bureaucrat must aggregate diverse
   non-standard data inputs and translate those into standard formats
   for consumption by an executive or other decision maker. In this
   case the bureaucrat is ofthen not empowered to reach a final
   decision but must have a much greater understanding of the inputs
   than within a certification workflow.

Both of these transactions share a common workflow, but their
priorities differ. Information starts as raw data, is interpreted, and
becomes a black and white result. For certification workflows,
transparency of the data and how it is transformed into the final
decision is paramount. For information gathering, trust in the
competency of the staff is the most important aspect. As with any
monetary task speed, cost, and quality all define the effectiveness of
the process.

In a dry protocol, one doesn't have to worry so much about the
incentives of the conduit, just the perceived state of a message
transmitter and the message receiver. This is definitely not the case
with a bureaucratic protocol. The bureaucrat's incentives are
essential. In order to ensure bureacracies are efficient and effective
those incentives must be well aligned with the intention of the
protocol itself.

One of the most important aspects is motivation: does a bureaucrats
motivations align with the intention of the protocol itself? Or are
they mis-aligned?

Ideas to explore. What are the incentives associated with a bureaucrats:

#. interaction with protocol inputs
#. interaction with protocol outputs
#. monotony of the workflow
#. exhaustion of the workflow
#. motivation to understand the underlying problem(s) the protocol is
   designed to solve
#. empowerment to fix or improve the workflow
