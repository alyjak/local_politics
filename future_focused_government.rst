I believe that one of the principle roles of effective government is to protect
and grow our common future. I believe progressive parties are the closest
political affiliation for sharing this belief with me.

Breaking this down, a few key points emerge that need to be addressed.

#. Progress involves change, and change is inherently risky because political
   change cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.

   #. This implies that rolling out a political change should be done with
      evidence, and also with a roll-back plan. Similar to what's done with
      critical software

#. The future involves unpredictable catastrophic events and abject
   sociopolitical failure must be considered a real possibility.

   #. This implies that states can fail. Since failure can propagate, and state
      failures have predictable consequences, this means that there must be a
      common means to identify and deal with failed states in order to ensure,
      in order of priority: 1) The failure does not propagate to neighboring
      states or localities, 2) The basic human rights of the constituents of the
      failed state are protected as much as possible, 3) The failed state is
      stabilized and given the resources to reach a minimum level of working
      governance as quickly as possible

Both of these points have a correlary that aids in the implementation of
effective governance that can handle these points -- state size should be
minimized, as this helps to contain the risk of failure.
